Snowflake Data Warehouse Implementation Secured | Scalable | Streamlined

This Snowflake end-to-end project was built around a layered data warehouse architecture, designed to ensure secure data processing and effective data governance. The process began with the ingestion of data from multiple sources—including APIs, flat files, and databases. A thorough analysis was conducted to determine the number of layers needed, the architectural layout, and the business requirements for building the warehouse. This included identifying the required dimensions, deciding which attributes belong to dimension vs. fact tables, and integrating data into a Snowflake-standard tabular format. The data was organized into structured schemas, where formatting issues were corrected, duplicates were removed, and missing data was handled systematically to ensure data accuracy and minimize redundancy. The use of fact and dimension tables helped in maintaining normalized relationships and improving the efficiency of analytical queries.

From an implementation standpoint, the process involved creating separate schemas for each layer—Staging, Raw, Clean, and Data Mart—to isolate and manage the data transformation process step-by-step. Initial data was loaded into the Staging layer, followed by structured loading into the Raw layer using Snowflake’s COPY command. Clean tables were then created with the necessary attributes, and data mapping was performed from raw to clean layers. In the Clean layer, various data cleaning techniques were applied such as removing nulls, handling missing values using statistical methods (mean, median, mode, or regression techniques), and validating data consistency both before and after the cleaning process. These practices ensured that the data was accurate, reliable, and ready for modeling.

The final phase focused on data modeling using the cleaned dataset as the source to create well-defined dimension and fact tables. Relationships were established using primary and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity. Depending on the complexity and volume of the data, the model could include multiple dimensions and multiple fact tables. To orchestrate and monitor the pipeline flow effectively, we created Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that visually represented each step of the transformation process. These DAGs, along with Snowflake’s query logs and history tools, were instrumental in troubleshooting and debugging during development. Overall, the project significantly improved data quality, enabled scalable reporting, and supported downstream analytics tools such as Power BI and Tableau.
